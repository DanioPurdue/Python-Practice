# Random

```python
randrange(start, end, step) #gives an input, there are other signatures for this function
random() # number between 0 to 1, every one is equally likely
choice(seq)
random.shuffle(seq)	#shuffle the sequence
```

```python
a = float(raw_input()) #raw_input() was renamed into input in newer version of python
```
